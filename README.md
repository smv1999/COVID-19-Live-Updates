# COVID-19-Live-Updates

## 1.Introduction
The number of COVID-19 cases are increasing at a higher rate everyday worldwide. We need to be safe and stay at home. Many forwarded messages in social media provide false information about the virus and status of the cases worldwide. So, it is necessary to correct information regarding this. I have created a simple application in python that scraps data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India Official Website and display the data in the form of chart for visualization and the data is displayed in a tabular format.

## 2.Getting Started and Setup
* Clone or download this repository as ZIP format.
* Requirements: You can install the Python packages by using this command in the Command Prompt: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* After that you are good to proceed to see a demo of the application.
* Run the project using `python main.py` and you can see the Data Visualization and the tabular format as the output.
